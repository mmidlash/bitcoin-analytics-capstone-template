    "- DCA is a reasonable baseline Bitcoin accumulation strategy in the absence of other strong signals. However, its performance depends on overall market regime conditions such as bull/bear/sideways and high/low volatility. Other baseline strategies such as using moving averages appear to be more effective in some market conditions. As a result, regime analysis will play a signficant role in developing the accumulation strategy. \n",

    "- Polymarket data will likely play a role in the accumulation strategy, with the activity and sentiment of Bitcoin markets providing useful information. After activity shocks in Polymarket BTC markets (spikes in trading volume regardless of the sentiment), Bitcoin tends to outperform the baseline over the following 30 and 60 days. After sentiment shocks (spikes in bullish activity), Bitcoin tends to underperform the baseline, but with less statistical signficance. This suggests that attention on these Bitcoin markets could be a leading indicator, while the sentiment of these bets could act as a contrarian signal. "
